1. Import Libraries
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules
2. Data Preprocessing
python
# Load the raw data into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/data.csv')

# Perform any necessary data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, removing duplicates)

# Convert categorical data to one-hot encoding
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data)

# You can also perform other preprocessing steps such as scaling numeric features if needed
3. Association Analysis
# Perform market basket analysis using Apriori algorithm
frequent_itemsets = apriori(data_encoded, min_support=0.1, use_colnames=True)

# Generate association rules
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="confidence", min_threshold=0.7)
# Print the association rules
print(rules)
In this example:
•	data.csv is your raw data file containing transactional data, where each row represents a transaction, and columns represent items bought in that transaction.
•	min_support is the minimum support threshold for itemsets to be considered frequent. Adjust this based on your dataset.
•	min_threshold is the minimum confidence threshold for the association rules. Again, adjust this based on your requirements.

Dependencies:
•	Python 3.x
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Scikit-learn
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
Installation:
1.	Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download and install it from python.org.
2.	Install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage:
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/priyadharsiniamirtha/market-basket-insights.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd market-basket-insights
3.	Place your market basket data file (e.g., market_basket_data.csv) in the project directory.
4.	Modify the config.py file to specify the input file name, delimiter, and other configuration parameters if necessary.
5.	Run the main script:
python market_basket_analysis.py
